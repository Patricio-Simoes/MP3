An app that allows you to simulate a small back transaction system.
You can use it to track your deposits and withdrawals.
In this version, there is nothing preventing you to insert an invalid date. Meaning you could insert something like dd/mm/yyyy or yyyy-mm-dd or even something like "er".
There is also a small issue when binding the movements list in the model to the main window's list view, you can't really see the data as you were supposed to... I may try to fix this later.
