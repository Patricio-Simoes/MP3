This App allows you to modify a txt file read from anywhere withing your pc.
It allows you to:
- Manually overwrite and save it;
- Replace all occurrences of a give word to another given word;
- Delete all text between parentheses;
- It couts the number os characters, words, specific words and paragraphs.

There is however a small bug.
If you go to the 2nd window (The one that replaces words), close it through the App red cross instead of the cancel button and then try to open it again, it would crash if not for the catch statement.
This does not happen if you close it through the cancel button.
